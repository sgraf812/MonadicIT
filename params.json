{"name":"MonadicIT","tagline":"A simple message transmission system simulation utilizing monads","body":"MonadicIT\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThis project is part of my Bachelor's thesis and serves as a case study for how monads can be utilized \r\nin projects where benefit or usage are not immediately obvious.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seemed like a fun project to apply my knowledge gained in an information theory lecture.\r\nIn trying my best to visualize each layer as my intuition dictates, I hope to help people having a \r\nhard time to grasp this and speeding up their building up of intuition.\r\n\r\nOf course this is far from complete as this project to date only serves as a proof of concept for thesis.\r\nYet extending it with different kinds of encoding techniques could be worthwhile and fun. \r\nBut, you know, I got only a finite amount of time to spare :)\r\n\r\nHow To Build\r\n============\r\n\r\nDevelopment was done with VS 2013, although VS 2012 could possibly work, too. I had .NET 4.5 installed, but .NET 4.0 should be fine too. Off the top of my head, I use C# 5 features. NuGet should download the referenced packages on build by itself.\r\n\r\nHow To Run\r\n==========\r\n\r\nA Windows installation with .NET 4.0 Client Profile is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe source code is licensed under the MIT license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
