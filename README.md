MonadicIT
=========

This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis and serves as a case study for how monads can be utilized 
in projects where benefit or usage are not immediately obvious.

Also, it seemed like a fun project to apply my knowledge gained in an information theory lecture.
In trying my best to visualize each layer as my intuition dictates, I hope to help people having a 
hard time to grasp this and speeding up their building up of intuition.

Of course this is far from complete as this project to date only serves as a proof of concept for thesis.
Yet extending it with different kinds of encoding techniques could be worthwhile and fun. 
But, you know, I got only a finite amount of time to spare :)
